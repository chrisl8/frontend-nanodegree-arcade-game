Udacity Javascript Game Assignment
===============================

To "install" the game just put all of these files in any folder and run (double click on) the "index.html" file.

This game is part of an assignment for a Udacity class.

In order to play use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the character
left, right, up or down.

Avoid the enemy "bugs". If one hits you you will be sent to the start again.

If you reach the other side you win and you are sent to the start
for another attempt.
The "Crossings" count will show how many times you made it across.
